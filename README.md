This project is a webApp which shows statements (some controversal) to users and asks them if they Agree or Disagree with the statement.

The webapp will then show them the percentage of those who Agreed or Disagreed and to see if their share the opinion of the majority or if they opinion is different from most.


Functionality.

This part of the project is the server side of the project. The second part will incorporate the client side.

I currently have 2 models: Statements and users. 

statements holds, statement ID (Number), the actual statement (String), agree field (number) and a disagree field (number). The  agree and disagree field will keep count of the number of users who agreed or disagreed with that statement.

users holds users information including, name (String), email (String), password (String), agree (Number), disagree(Number).

From the server side you can do the following:
Get all statements.
Get one statement by id.
Post (add) a statement, this gives the new statement the next available id.
Put update the agree field if the user agrees with the statement.
Put update the disagree field if the user disagrees with the statement.
Delete a statement by id.

Get all users, returns all the users.
Post (add) a user with a unigue id.
Delete a user based on the id.

The database has online persistence using mongodb.atlas.

I created a github repository and uploaded the initial project. i continued to push updates to github each time i added new code or updated code.

I used comments where ever appropriate.
